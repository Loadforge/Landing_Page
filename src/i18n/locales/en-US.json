  "aboutSection": {
    "heading": "About LoadForge",
    "p1": "LoadForge is a project being developed as part of the Capstone (TCC) at FATEC Zona Sul. It is an HTTP client aimed at developers and testers, designed to simplify sending HTTP requests for different purposes such as API testing, load simulations and server response inspection.",
    "p2": "Inspired by widely used tools like Postman and Insomnia, LoadForge aims to offer a similar experience with specific differentiators: focus on lightness, performance and usability. It allows sending GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and other methods, and viewing responses in multiple formats (JSON, text, HTML) with details such as status code, headers and response time.",
    "p3": "A key differentiator is using Rust on the backend. Rust was chosen for its high performance, memory safety and excellent support for concurrency (multi‑threading) — ideal for applications that must handle high volumes of simultaneous requests, like load testing. This makes LoadForge especially effective at simulating real stress scenarios on servers and APIs and analyzing system behavior precisely."
